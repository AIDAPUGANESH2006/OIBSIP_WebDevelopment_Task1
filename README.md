# Modern Web-Based Calculator

##  Objective

The objective of this project is to design and develop a modern, responsive web-based calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. The project aims to strengthen understanding of frontend web development concepts including layout design, DOM manipulation, event handling, and Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript.

##  Tools & Technologies Used

- HTML5 – For creating the structure of the application  
- CSS3 – For styling and designing the user interface  
- JavaScript (ES6) – For implementing logic and interactivity  
- CSS Grid – For button alignment and layout design  
- VS Code – As the code editor  
- Web Browser (Chrome/Edge) – For testing and execution

##  Steps Performed

1. Created the basic HTML structure including display and buttons.
2. Designed the calculator layout using CSS Grid for proper alignment.
3. Applied a modern color theme and hover effects using CSS.
4. Implemented calculator logic using JavaScript.
5. Used Object-Oriented Programming (Calculator class) to organize the code.
6. Added functionality for:
   - Arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷, %)
   - Clear (AC) button
   - Delete (DEL) button
   - Keyboard input support
7. Implemented error handling for invalid operations such as division by zero.
8. Tested the application for responsiveness and functionality.
